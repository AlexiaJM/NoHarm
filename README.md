# Just World License

**A licence for developers who write open source code to make the world a better place**

As developers we can no longer close our eyes to the fact that open source code
is being used by individuals and organisations to the detriment of our society.

The Just World License is for developers that agree in general with the principles
of open source software, but are uncomfortable with their software being used
as part of efforts to destroy lives, our environment and our future.

In short, developers who use this license want their code to contribute to a
just world for all.

This license is based on the [BSD 3-clause license](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html),
but with specific exclusions for using licensed code to promote or profit from:

* violence, hate and division,
* environmental destruction,
* abuse of human rights,
* the destruction of peopleâ€™s physical and mental health

# Contributing

As with all things open source, contributions are welcome.
If you would like to suggest improvements, please open an issue.

We prefer additions that:

1. Add clarity,
2. Address an important issue that we have overlooked, and
3. Are concise (don't require lengthy legal definitions, though we know this isn't always possible).

Issues that are opened in order to debate ideology, express
climate skepticism, promote discrimination or divisiveness, etc will be closed.
